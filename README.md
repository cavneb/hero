## Its a bird, its a plane, its... its... my Hero

*Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. -- [Brian Kernighan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan)*

I've seen my share of poor app structure. 
Hell, I wrote most of it.
Whether is fat controllers, giant models with mystery callbacks, or a junk drawer lib directory.

The question remains. **Where do I put my business logic?**

Finally... an answer that might even make DHH proud. 
One that evolved from the real world with concrete use cases and actual production code.

## Why Hero?

* App structure matches the mental map of your business
* Testable coponents
* Faster ramp up time for new team members
* Easily handles changing requirements 

### Process Modeling

The problem has always been: **How do you effectively model a business process within your app?**

Things start simply enough but eventually edge cases force *gotchas* into
various libs, modules, and classes. Before you know you it,
you have a lump of spaghetti that's difficult to maintain and even harder to improve.

Hero provides a simple pattern that encourages you to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decompose</a>
these processes into managable chunks. And the best part... the components can be easily tested.

More soon. Stay tuned...
